# Creating an Flutter app where is show a text from Firebase cloud 

Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows you to write an app in one codebase and compile to both Android and iOS. Firebase is a mobile development platform that provides a back end to support your apps, and Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database where you can store, sync, and query data for your mobile apps. Together, this trio of Google solutions can eliminate many of the more tedious aspects of mobile developmentâ€”helping you take your apps from concept to deployment at rapid speed. In this course, instructor Chiu-Ki Chan shows how to create an app using Flutter on the mobile side, Firebase on the back end, and Cloud Firestore to store data. Learn how to set up a Flutter app, create a Firebase project and configure your app with this project, and store your data in Cloud Firestore.
